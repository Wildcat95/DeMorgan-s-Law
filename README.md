# DeMorgan-s-Law
DeMorgan's Law Knowledge Test


This was a team project for a software engineering class.

The purpose of this program is to teach DeMorgan's Law through a short question and answer quiz. It isn't elaborate, but it does provide a foundation that can be expanded on.

We have the two .py files, main.py and Problem.py, and three .txt files, questions.txt, answers.txt and explanations.txt.

Main.py is where the details of our GUI are located. For our GUI, we used tkinter, as it is very user friendly, and we were all at only an intermediate level of Python.

Problem.py is where the meat of the program is. This is where we are pulling our information from our .txt files as we are taking the quiz.
  Inside problem.py, we also have our radio button functionalities. If you click this, you get this, if you get it right, this is what happens, and so on.

If you get an answer wrong, we have provided an explanation as to why the correct answer is in fact the correct answer.

As you go through the quiz, your score is added along the way, and when finished, you are presented with your total score.

Hopefully you find it useful and/or wish to expand on it.
